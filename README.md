Reslife App
Creation of a mobile application natively on ios and android that is meant to be used by the employees of uottawa's residence service. In addition to add, a coordinator portal will be built to allow the residence coordos to have a hand on the app content. The app will play the role of a centralized task and info manager for Community Advisors (RAs), Team Leads, and Coordinators. We will use React Native to develop the front end natively on both Ios and android and the choice for the backend is still the be made
